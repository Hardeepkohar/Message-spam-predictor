# Message-spam-predictor
A classifier that can predict whether or not the provided message or SMS is 'SPAM' or 'NOT SPAM'

This classification model has an accuracy score of 97.89% and a Precision score of 1.0 !!!

The dataset was taken from kaggle named 'spam'

In this project, simple technique is used to remove all the stop words in english language along with the punctuation marks from the text message and keep only the important words

nltk package is used modify the words in terms of verb to focus only on the words and not the different versions of the same word.

Vectorization techniques used for feature extraction were 'Bag of words' and 'TF-IDF'

The best algorithm selected was Multinomial Naive Bayes.

The MnB model was tested against various machine learning classifiers----
- Logistic Regression\
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support vector classifier
- Random forest classifier
- K nearest neighbours classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
