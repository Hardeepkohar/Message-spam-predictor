-- nltk package is used modify the words in terms of verb to focus only on the words and not the different versions of the same word.
-- Vectorization techniques used for feature extraction were 'Bag of words' and 'TF-IDF'
-- The best algorithm selected was Multinomial Naive Bayes.

The MnB model was tested against various machine learning classifiers----
- Logistic Regression\
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support vector classifier
- Random forest classifier
- K nearest neighbours classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
